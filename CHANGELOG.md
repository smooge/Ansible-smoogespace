# Changelog


## Overall Notes:

This set of ansible playbooks and operations will be templated off of
the Debops project. As such, we will be following their best practices
in using https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/ as our changelog format.

General usage will be to add items with reasoning to each change log
section. When it is ready to be released, follow the semantic versioning
which best meets our needs (currently
https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), update released to that version
and then copy the template at the bottom of the file as the new
'Unreleased' section.
