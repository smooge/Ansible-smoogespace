# xenadu

xenadu is a Dell T20 which is used for work and configuration of Smoogespace work. It's original mission was to run small virtual machines which can be used for testing and configuration. However the system only has 4 core's so the virtual machines were overtaxed. It's current mission is to mirror software from other sites and do some x86_64 software builds as needed.
